"The Road Not Taken","Robert Frost","Two roads diverged in a yellow wood,\nAnd sorry I could not travel both\nAnd be one traveler, long I stood\nAnd looked down one as far as I could\nTo where it bent in the undergrowth;\n\nThen took the other, as just as fair,\nAnd having perhaps the better claim,\nBecause it was grassy and wanted wear;\nThough as for that the passing there\nHad worn them really about the same"
"Hope is the thing with feathers","Emily Dickinson","Hope is the thing with feathers\nThat perches in the soul,\nAnd sings the tune without the words,\nAnd never stops at all,\n\nAnd sweetest in the gale is heard;\nAnd sore must be the storm\nThat could abash the little bird\nThat kept so many warm."
"Invictus","William Ernest Henley","Out of the night that covers me,\nBlack as the pit from pole to pole,\nI thank whatever gods may be\nFor my unconquerable soul.\n\nIn the fell clutch of circumstance\nI have not winced nor cried aloud.\nUnder the bludgeonings of chance\nMy head is bloody, but unbowed."
"Still I Rise","Maya Angelou","You may write me down in history\nWith your bitter, twisted lies,\nYou may tread me in the very dirt\nBut still, like dust, I'll rise.\n\nDoes my sassiness upset you?\nWhy are you beset with gloom?\n'Cause I walk like I've got oil wells\nPumping in my living room."
"The Guest House","Rumi","This being human is a guest house.\nEvery morning a new arrival.\n\nA joy, a depression, a meanness,\nsome momentary awareness comes\nas an unexpected visitor.\n\nWelcome and entertain them all!\nEven if they're a crowd of sorrows,\nwho violently sweep your house\nempty of its furniture"
"Phenomenal Woman","Maya Angelou","Pretty women wonder where my secret lies.\nI'm not cute or built to suit a fashion model's size\nBut when I start to tell them,\nThey think I'm telling lies.\n\nI say,\nIt's in the reach of my arms,\nThe span of my hips,\nThe stride of my step,\nThe curl of my lips.\nI'm a woman\nPhenomenally."
"Fire and Ice","Robert Frost","Some say the world will end in fire,\nSome say in ice.\nFrom what I've tasted of desire\nI hold with those who favor fire.\nBut if it had to perish twice,\nI think I know enough of hate\nTo say that for destruction ice\nIs also great\nAnd would suffice."
"A Dream Deferred","Langston Hughes","What happens to a dream deferred?\n\nDoes it dry up\nlike a raisin in the sun?\nOr fester like a sore—\nAnd then run?\nDoes it stink like rotten meat?\nOr crust and sugar over—\nlike a syrupy sweet?\n\nMaybe it just sags\nlike a heavy load.\n\nOr does it explode?"
"Do Not Go Gentle Into That Good Night","Dylan Thomas","Do not go gentle into that good night,\nOld age should burn and rave at close of day;\nRage, rage against the dying of the light.\n\nThough wise men at their end know dark is right,\nBecause their words had forked no lightning they\nDo not go gentle into that good night."
"The Love Song of J. Alfred Prufrock","T.S. Eliot","Let us go then, you and I,\nWhen the evening is spread out against the sky\nLike a patient etherized upon a table;\nLet us go, through certain half-deserted streets,\nThe muttering retreats\nOf restless nights in one-night cheap hotels"
"If","Rudyard Kipling","If you can keep your head when all about you\nAre losing theirs and blaming it on you,\nIf you can trust yourself when all men doubt you,\nBut make allowance for their doubting too;\n\nIf you can wait and not be tired by waiting,\nOr being lied about, don't deal in lies,\nOr being hated, don't give way to hating,\nAnd yet don't look too good, nor talk too wise"
"She Walks in Beauty","Lord Byron","She walks in beauty, like the night\nOf cloudless climes and starry skies;\nAnd all that's best of dark and bright\nMeet in her aspect and her eyes;\n\nThus mellowed to that tender light\nWhich heaven to gaudy day denies.\n\nOne shade the more, one ray the less,\nHad half impaired the nameless grace"
"Ozymandias","Percy Bysshe Shelley","I met a traveller from an antique land,\nWho said—Two vast and trunkless legs of stone\nStand in the desert. Near them, on the sand,\nHalf sunk a shattered visage lies, whose frown,\n\nAnd wrinkled lip, and sneer of cold command,\nTell that its sculptor well those passions read\nWhich yet survive, stamped on these lifeless things"
"The Raven","Edgar Allan Poe","Once upon a midnight dreary, while I pondered, weak and weary,\nOver many a quaint and curious volume of forgotten lore—\nWhile I nodded, nearly napping, suddenly there came a tapping,\nAs of some one gently rapping, rapping at my chamber door.\n\n'Tis some visitor,' I muttered, 'tapping at my chamber door—\nOnly this and nothing more.'"
"Stopping by Woods on a Snowy Evening","Robert Frost","Whose woods these are I think I know.\nHis house is in the village though;\nHe will not see me stopping here\nTo watch his woods fill up with snow.\n\nMy little horse must think it queer\nTo stop without a farmhouse near\nBetween the woods and frozen lake\nThe darkest evening of the year."
