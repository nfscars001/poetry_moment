# ðŸ“¦ Complete Poetry Website Package

## Files to Download and Package

I've created all the files for your poetry sharing website. Here's what you need to do:

### 1. Create the Files

Create these 4 files in the same folder:

#### `index.html`
- Copy the content from the "index.html" artifact above
- This is your main website file

#### `poems.csv`  
- Copy the content from the "poems.csv" artifact above
- Contains 15 sample poems in the correct format
- Replace with your own poems later

#### `watermark.png`
- Use your existing PNG watermark file
- Place it in the same folder as the other files
- The website will automatically use it

#### `README.md`
- Copy the content from the "README.md" artifact above
- Contains complete documentation and instructions

### 2. File Structure
```
poetry-website/
â”œâ”€â”€ index.html          # Main website
â”œâ”€â”€ poems.csv           # Your poem database  
â”œâ”€â”€ watermark.png       # Your watermark image
â””â”€â”€ README.md          # Documentation
```

### 3. Creating a ZIP Package

**On Windows:**
1. Select all 4 files
2. Right-click and choose "Send to" â†’ "Compressed (zipped) folder"
3. Name it `poetry-website.zip`

**On Mac:**
1. Select all 4 files
2. Right-click and choose "Compress Items"
3. Rename to `poetry-website.zip`

**On Linux:**
```bash
zip -r poetry-website.zip index.html poems.csv watermark.png README.md
```

### 4. Testing Your Package

1. Extract the ZIP file to a new folder
2. Open `index.html` in a web browser
3. You should see a random poem displayed
4. Click "New Poem" to test poem cycling
5. Click "Save as Image" to test image generation

### 5. Customizing Your Package

**Adding Your Poems:**
1. Edit `poems.csv` in Excel or any text editor
2. Replace the sample poems with your collection
3. Follow the format: `title,author,content`
4. Use `\n` for line breaks in poems

**Using Your Watermark:**
1. Replace `watermark.png` with your logo
2. Recommended size: 80x80 pixels or larger
3. PNG format with transparency works best
