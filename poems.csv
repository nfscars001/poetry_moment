Happiness?,Wei In Sight a.k.a. The Prof,"True joy lies not in fleeting gold,\nNor in tales by wealth untold.\nItâ€™s found in moments, simple and near,\nLoveâ€™s embrace, laughter clear.\nIn shared sunsets and friendshipâ€™s gleam,\nHappiness, a heartfelt dream.\nNot in riches or fameâ€™s caress,\nBut in lifeâ€™s essence, pure happiness."
Purpose of life,Wei In Sight a.k.a. The Prof,"Lifeâ€™s purpose, a quest profound,\nIn fleeting moments, truth is found.\nTo learn, to love, to leave a trace,\nIn the vast tapestry of time and space.\nNot in possessions or worldly gain,\nBut in connections, joy, and pain.\nTo sow compassion, wisdomâ€™s seed,\nA purpose found in every deed.\nAs we journey from dawn to night,\nTo weave a tale of grace and light.\nIn the legacy of kindness we leave,\nThe purpose of life, our spirits conceive."
Love,Wei In Sight a.k.a. The Prof,"A whisper heard when all is still,\nA hand to hold, a heart to fill.\nIt blooms in silence, speaks in grace,\nA gentle light in every place.\nIt weeps with you, it laughs out loud,\nIt lifts you up above the crowd.\nNot bound by time, nor worn by years,\nIt deepens most through joy and tears.\nNo need for gold, nor throne above,\nThe richest soul is one in love.\nA whisper heard when all is still,\nA hand to hold, a heart to fill.\nIt blooms in silence, speaks in grace,\nA gentle light in every place.\nIt weeps with you, it laughs out loud,\nIt lifts you up above the crowd.\nNot bound by time, nor worn by years,\nIt deepens most through joy and tears.\nNo need for gold, nor throne above,\nThe richest soul is one in love.\n"
Ocean and sky,Wei In Sight a.k.a. The Prof,"Endless blue meets endless height,\nA dance of waves, a kiss of light.\nThe oceanÕs roar, the skyÕs soft sigh,\nWhere sea foam dreams and seagulls fly.\nOne reflects, one holds above,\nBoundless realms of fear and love.\nTogether vast, together highÑ\nThe sacred bond of ocean and sky."
Social media,Wei In Sight a.k.a. The Prof,"To me, it is  not likes or fame,\nBut glimpses framed in light and name.\nA gallery wall for the soul to bring\nA place to share each beautiful thing."
